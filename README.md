## Overview

This project is the final deliverable of the **Microsoft Power BI: PL-300 Certification Prep (Data Analyst) course**, which I completed through Udemy. The course, taught by Maven Analytics and led by instructor Aaron Perry, focused on preparing students for the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate (PL-300) certification exam**.

The project simulates a real-world business scenario using a fictional dataset created by the course instructor. The goal of the project is to demonstrate mastery of Power BI tools, from data preparation and analysis to designing interactive reports and dashboards.

The objective of this project was to analyze and report on various business metrics for a fictional bicycle company, Maven Cycles. Using Power BI, I developed a comprehensive report for executive stakeholders, incorporating essential business insights and enabling drill-down features for deeper analysis.

## Steps and Workflow
The completion of this project followed a structured process, aligned with the content taught in the PL-300 preparation course:

**1. Data Loading & Transformation:**

1) Loaded the provided dataset into Power BI.
2) Performed essential transformations such as renaming columns, changing data types, and removing unnecessary columns.
3) Cleaned the data using Power Query Editor to ensure it was ready for analysis.

**2. Data Modeling:**

1) Created relationships between different tables in the dataset to build an appropriate data model.
2) Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures to support the analysis.
3) Built measures for key business metrics, such as total sales, profit, and customer segments.

**3. Data Visualization:**

1) Designed interactive visuals, including bar charts, line graphs, KPIs, and matrix tables.
2) Used slicers and filters to enhance the ability to drill down into specific segments of the data, such as product categories or regions.
3) Integrated Power BI's native filtering capabilities to allow executives to customize views based on their needs.

**4. Dashboard Design:**

1) Built a comprehensive dashboard that visually presents key insights in an easy-to-read format for executives.
2) Incorporated a clean layout, with attention to usability, ensuring that the most critical business information is easy to find.

**5. Publishing & Sharing:**

1) Published the completed report to the Power BI service (Power BI Web), enabling web-based access.
2) Created a mobile-optimized view of the report for executives who may access it via mobile devices.

**6. Automation:**

1) Set up scheduled data refreshes to ensure that the report remains up to date with the latest data.

4) Set up an automated data refresh schedule to keep the report updated.

This project not only reinforces my skills in data analysis and visualization but also showcases my ability to deliver comprehensive reports suitable for real-world business decision-making.

## How to View the Project

You can download and view the report using Power BI Desktop. The dataset and PBIX file are included in this repository for reference. All course content are in the pdf file, which is a presentation slide for this course.
